# CV_for_Football_Analysis_YOLOv8

A simple classical streamlit web application for object detection in Football match with tactical map representation using Homograph Transformation and YOLOv8.

The purpose of this project is to address the challenge of real-time football match analysis, focusing on accurate team identification and player tracking through computer vision techniques. The research aims to develop a robust system that combines object detection, homography transformations, and color palette prediction to improve performance in detecting teams, players, and their movements on the field. The primary method employed is YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect players and ball positions in video footage. Homography transformations are then applied to correct perspective distortions, providing a more accurate spatial representation of the field. Additionally, a color palette-based prediction system is used to identify teams based on jersey colors, further enhancing the tracking and analysis process. The results show significant improvements in detection accuracy, with the system achieving high precision and recall in identifying players and tracking their movements across the field. The findings suggest that the integration of YOLOv8, homography corrections, and color palette based team identification is highly effective for real-time football match analysis. This study opens avenues for future research on refining object detection models and exploring more advanced tracking methods for dynamic sports environments.
